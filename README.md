# Open Rresearch #

The goal of this project is to create, catalog, and track progress on AI research ideas that I have. Ideally, others will also contribute with their own ideas and/or implementations of my incomplete ideas.  Feel free to create pull requests.

The main organization of projects should fall into 3 categories:
- Infrastructure: I am considering infrastructure to be tools common to multiple projects including things like dataset handling and manipulation.
- Architecture: I am considering architecture to be tests and results of new neural network models with novel designs
- Components: I am considering components to be low level parts like new layers, regularizations, or loss functions common to different architectures

I hope to keep this updated with a wish list of what I hope to work on when I have free time.
